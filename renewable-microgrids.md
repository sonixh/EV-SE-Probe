# Renewable Microgrids

## Microgrid Definition

group of interconnected distributed energy resources and loads within clearly defined boundaries that act as a single controllable entity

can operate independently or connected to grid needs monitoring and control

* 1kW to 100 MW
* building block of the Smart Grid
* **Virtual power plant --&gt;** collection of resources \(mostly generation\) does not operate off grid, cluster of DERs

## Benefits of Microgrids

* reliable
* availability
* resilience --&gt; withstand disruptions, come back after failure
  * multiple energy sources leads to greater resilience
* scalability --&gt; each microgrid unique so it's hard to come up with scalable approaches to minimize cost
  * unique power and energy goals
* commitment to renewable energy
* reduce electric bill by reducing energy or peak demand charges
* selling dispatchable power to grid especially high value grid services
* **value stacking** --&gt; microgrid may be more expensive up front, but after add up costs, traditional more expensive when there is a failure
* decentralization
* decarbonization
* digitalization
* dollarizing it ---&gt; finding value in new services and capabilities to justify additional expenses

## Regulatory Issues

* **behind the meter --&gt;** customer side
* microgrids undefined in most states
